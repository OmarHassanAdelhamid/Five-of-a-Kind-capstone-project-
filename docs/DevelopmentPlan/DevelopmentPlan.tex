\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

Git will be utilized as the primary, centralized collaboration space for both project
source code and its related documentation. Members will create new branches for each
feature to be implemented, as well as per each member (eg. branches will not be shared).
When a member is complete with their work on a given branch, they will create a pull request
with appropriate labels and assignees. For instance, an acceptable assignee could be someone
working on a related feature. Labels should give an estimate of how long it might take to
review. Each pull request should also be linked to a given issue.

A milestone will be created for each deliverable (both documentation and revisions) and issgit ues
created will be associated with it. Issue templates will be used in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item lecture: to track attendance as well as general notes/questions
  \item meeting(s): to record meeting minutes, attendance, and catch up members that miss the meeting
  \item peer review: to request another team review a given section
\end{itemize}

Additionally, for general issues, new labels will be created:

\begin{itemize}
  \item documentation
  \item code
  \item question
  \item easy / hard
  \item bug-fix
  \item need help
\end{itemize}

All issues should also contain a reasonable description describing the bug / feature / 
section of documentation.

To incorporate continuous integration, upon each push/pull request, all tests in the test suite
will be run automatically via GitHub Actions.

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\iffalse
\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}
\fi

The team will use Github Projects as the central platform to monitor the progress of the project. This tool will help ensure that issues/tasks are organized, responsibilities are clear, and the project is on track. The link to the Github project is here: \href{https://github.com/users/OmarHassanAdelhamid/projects/2/views/1}{Github Project}.

\subsection{Github Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Github Projects will be used to plan, manage, and track the workflow by creating issues and organizing them through the different stages of the project.
  \item Each issue will be labeled appropriately to help organize them and provide clarity on the progress of the project.
  \item Issues will be assigned to team members to clearly identify ownership and responsibility.
  \item Issues will be linked to different project stages to show how tasks move through the development cycle
  \item Issues on the project will be linked to the different deliverables of the project to help track the progress of the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Scheduling}

The project will be scheduled based on the capstone deliverables, the team will prioritize the deliverables and schedule them accordingly. At each deliverable, the sections will be broken down into smaller tasks and these tasks will be assigned to team members. The project will be scheduled to be completed in a timely manner, and to be completed to a high quality. Below is a table of the project deliverables and their corresponding due dates.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{Xc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Deliverable} & \textbf{Due Date} \\
    \midrule
    Problem Statement, Proof of Concept, and Development Plan &

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

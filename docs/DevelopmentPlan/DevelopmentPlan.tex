\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the

{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

Git will be utilized as the primary, centralized collaboration space for both project
source code and its related documentation. Members will create new branches for each
feature to be implemented, as well as per each member (eg. branches will not be shared).
When a member is complete with their work on a given branch, they will create a pull request
with appropriate labels and assignees. For instance, an acceptable assignee could be someone
working on a related feature. Labels should give an estimate of how long it might take to
review. Each pull request should also be linked to a given issue.

A milestone will be created for each deliverable (both documentation and revisions) and issgit ues
created will be associated with it. Issue templates will be used in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item lecture: to track attendance as well as general notes/questions
  \item meeting(s): to record meeting minutes, attendance, and catch up members that miss the meeting
  \item peer review: to request another team review a given section
\end{itemize}

Additionally, for general issues, new labels will be created:

\begin{itemize}
  \item documentation
  \item code
  \item question
  \item easy / hard
  \item bug-fix
  \item need help
\end{itemize}

All issues should also contain a reasonable description describing the bug / feature / 
section of documentation.

To incorporate continuous integration, upon each push/pull request, all tests in the test suite
will be run automatically via GitHub Actions.

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}



The implementation of this project will be primarily web-based, with a
browser-accessible frontend and a local server backend with local saves on the client machine. The frontend will be
developed using \textbf{TypeScript} and \textbf{React}, with
\textbf{Redux Toolkit} for state management. For 3D voxel visualization and
interaction, the project expects to use \textbf{Three.js}, integrated with
React for rendering and manipulation.

On the backend, the project anticipates using \textbf{Python} with
\textbf{FastAPI} to provide REST endpoints for validating and normalizing voxel
data, as well as managing persistence. A local instance of
\textbf{PostgreSQL} is expected for structured storage of voxel geometries,
materials, and related metadata.

For code quality, the frontend will adopt \textbf{ESLint} as a linter, with
\textbf{Jest} for unit and integration testing. The backend will rely on
\textbf{pytest} for automated testing, with a tentative coverage goal of
approximately 80\%. Code coverage reporting will be handled with tools such as
\textbf{Istanbul}. Continuous integration will be performed using
\textbf{GitHub Actions}, with automated checks for linting, tests, and coverage
included in the pipeline.

Version control and project management will be conducted through
\textbf{git}, \textbf{GitHub}, and \textbf{GitHub Projects}, which will serve
as the central platforms for collaboration, task tracking, and issue
management.

\section{Coding Standard}

To ensure consistency, maintainability, and readability, the project will adopt
established coding standards for all areas of development.

For the \textbf{frontend} (TypeScript/React):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Variable and function names will use \textbf{camelCase}, while
  \textbf{PascalCase} will be used for React components.
  \item The principle of \textbf{DRY} (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) will guide code
  organization, promoting modular components and reusable utility functions.
  \item File and folder structures will be organized in a consistent
  \textbf{kebab-case} format for directories and filenames.
\end{itemize}

For the \textbf{backend} (Python/FastAPI):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Code will follow the \textbf{PEP~8} style guide
  \item Variable and function names will use \textbf{snake\_case}, while classes
  will be written in \textbf{PascalCase}.
\end{itemize}

Across both frontend and backend:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All code will be documented through inline comments and docstrings,
  particularly for APIs.
  \item \textbf{Unit tests} will accompany critical modules, following a goal of
  80\% code coverage.
  \item Commit messages will be written clearly and consistently, referencing
  related issues when applicable.
  \item Team members will adhere to software engineering principles such as
  \textbf{single responsibility}, \textbf{modularity}, and \textbf{clarity over
  cleverness}.
\end{itemize}

These conventions aim to produce code that is readable, maintainable, and
collaborative.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?

\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}
\iffalse
\wss{What will you be demonstrating}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}
\iffalse
\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}
\fi
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 8\\
Omar Hassan & 7\\
Daniel Maurer & 8\\
Andrew Bovbel & 7\\
Olivia Reich & 8\\
Khalid Farag & 7\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%update these numbers after tomorrow!
We often try to schedule our meetings such that everyone can attend; if people missed, it is due to them not
able to attend for a previously discussed reason.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}
\iffalse
\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}
\fi
\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: } [Dr.Onaizah]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Omar Hassan & 3\\
Daniel Maurer & 3\\
Andrew Bovbel & 3\\
Olivia Reich & 3\\
Khalid Farag & 3\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Scheduling meetings with the supervisor has been difficult given our schedules and Dr. Onaizah's schedule as well, 
however we do our best to remain in contact when possible.

\section{Lecture Attendance}
\iffalse
\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo. You can find the number of lectures in the time period of
interest by looking at the
\href{https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=rnboqiaki1k2la7rpu3bn0um58@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Toronto}
{Google calendar} for the capstone course.}
\fi
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 13\\
Omar Hassan & 9\\
Daniel Maurer & 13\\
Andrew Bovbel & 7\\
Olivia Reich & 9\\
Khalid Farag & 8\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We aim to have at least one person attending every lecture in order to be most up to date (ideally whoever can attend, attends).

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}
\iffalse
\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}
\fi
\noindent \textbf{TA's Name: } [Chris Schankula]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 2\\
Omar Hassan & 2\\
Daniel Maurer & 2\\
Andrew Bovbel & 2\\
Olivia Reich & 2\\
Khalid Farag & 2\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our team had fewer meetings with our TA due to his unavailability at the beginning of the term.

\section{Commits}
\iffalse
\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}
\fi
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & !! & 100\% \\
Omar Hassan & !! & !!\%\\ %omar please count your commits, git is not tracking them properly for some reason
Daniel Maurer & 81 & !!\%\\
Andrew Bovbel & 49 & !!\%\\
Olivia Reich & 35 & !!\%\\
Khalid Farag & 59 & \%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\iffalse
\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}
\fi

Some members have lower commits due to commit sizes being larger and less frequent (e.g. only commiting once an entire assigned
section is complete), and some have more due to commits being smaller and more frequent (this is especially true for hot-fix commits).

\section{Issue Tracker}
\iffalse
\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}
\fi
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Omar Hassan & 0 & 12\\
Daniel Maurer & 52 & 12\\
Andrew Bovbel & 0 & 11\\
Olivia Reich & 0 & 12\\
Khalid Farag & 3 & 11\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The large discrepancy in issue authorship is due to the assumed roles within our group; assigned much clearly reflects
the work divisions.

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

Our team has no other productivity metrics in use.

\section{Introduction}

The following sections aim to provide insight into our project and the role that hazard analysis
plays throughout its development. It introduces the concept of a hazard and how it may manifest
in software development. It then connects those ideas back to the scope of our current project.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Recently, master's students at McMaster University have been developing cutting-edge 3D
printer technology that has the capabilities of incorporating complex elements of
magnetization and multi-material components. However, with this innovative new design
comes the challenge of limited software capabilities that are unable to support the
unique needs of property assignment while simultaneously allowing an efficient and
intuitive design. Currently, developers of the 3D printer are forced to design their
model outside of COMSOL, which is the current software that permits magnetization assignment.
To build their model for printing, they must build their entire model voxel-by-voxel in
COMSOL, individually assigning each voxel a specific magnetization. This leads to an
unintuitive, time-consuming process that is unideal as they look to further test and develop
their printer. They require new software that can take a model built through AutoCAD and
provide a replica that has been sliced into voxels with the ability to easily assign
magnetization and material values to each voxel.

\subsection{Hazard Analysis Introduction}

As defined by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, a hazard can be
defined as any source of potential for harm, damage, or adverse effect to people, property,
or the environment [1]. Many of the typical factors that can contribute to a hazard,
including human error, unsafe working conditions, equipment malfunction, environmental
influences, and inadequate safety procedures. However, from the perspective of a software
developer, hazards can extend outside the factors listed above and may take form in data
corruption, unstable system components, poor development processes, security risks and
technological limitations. \par \vspace{1em}

As described above, our project aims to create software that supports slicing a
pre-existing model into voxels and permitting easy property assignment for future
printing processes.This project has the potential to greatly reduce the time, energy
and workload exerted on those using the multi-material 3D printer. However, to accomplish
this, there are many potential hazards that must be mitigated during system development.
These hazards may come from impractical technical implementations, incompatible input data
structures with pre-existing software or faulty output generation that could result in
unsafe or unintended behaviour in the physical system. Therefore, the hazard analysis
outlined below aims to identify and assess all hazards to ensure that our team is able to
successfully deploy a safe and reliable software system.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}

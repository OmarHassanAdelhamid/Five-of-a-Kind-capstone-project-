\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}


\iffalse
\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

Import Module & The system does not process the CAD file correctly as the user is expecting. & \textbullet{} The inputed STL file is corrupted therefore it can't be read by the system.\newline \textbullet{} The input file is not in the correct format so the system can't process it.& \textbullet{} The system can't process the file therefore it can't be sliced. \newline \textbullet{} Due to the confusion in system not reading the file, this will result in user frustration. \newline \textbullet{} It will lead to user spending more time to get the system to process the file. & When the file is first inputted into the system, the system will validate that the file is first in the correct format, and that it does not contain any corrupt information. This will then lead to the system prompting the user to re-enter the file or input a new one in. & F212, NF211, SCR1, SCR9 & H1 \\

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

In this section, we will be analyzing the safety requirements of the system. The following table will break down the potential safety requirements, their associated hazards, and their priority.

    \centering
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
        \toprule \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Value} \\
        \midrule
        MAX\_VOXEL\_COUNT & 103,680,000 voxels \\
        MAX\_VOXEL\_SELECTION & 1000 voxels \\

        MIN\_RENDER\_MEMORY & 16 GB \\

        AUTO\_SAVE\_INTERVAL & 5 minutes \\
        UNDO\_HISTORY\_SIZE & 10 actions \\
        FILE\_IMPORT\_EXPORT\_TIMEOUT &  2 minutes \\
        FEEDBACK\_UPDATE\_TIME & 30 seconds \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Symbolic Constants}
    \label{tab:sym}
\end{table}
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{SCR \arabic{enumi}.}

\item \emph{The system shall validated the importaed CAD files (STL/OBJ) for their format correctness before processing the model.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} The corrupted files can cause the system to fail and prevent successful voxelization to the workflow disruption.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} \texttt{INPUT\_FILE\_VALIDATION\_THRESH} of the imported files must pass the validation checks, and the system should reject any files that fail to do so.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H1\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system shall check if the device has enough memory and GPU capabilities before attempting to render 3D models and voxel grids.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} The insufficient memory or outdated GPU drivers can cause rendering failures with the system, preventing users from visualizing their models and proceeding with property assignments.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} The hardware where the system is running on must have at least \texttt{MIN\_RENDER\_MEMORY} of memory, and the GPU driver must be compatible with the system.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H2\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} Medium

\item \emph{The system shall maintain real-time synchronization between the UI component of selected/edited voxels and the backend data model.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Any failures in this synchronization can lead to user editing unintended voxels, causing incorrect property assignment and loss of user trust in system accuracy.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} \texttt{UI\_SYNC\_ACCURACY} of voxel selections and edits must be accurately reflected in both UI display and backend data model.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H3\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system shall validate all magnetization and material properties before exporting the file containing the metadata for all voxels.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Missing these important information can cause excessive time and material waste, and in some cases can cause printer failures.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} \texttt{EXPORT\_COMPLETENESS\_THRESH} of exported files must contain complete magnetization and material property data for all voxels.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H4\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system shall validate the CSV file format and structure before exporting the file, ensuring that it is compatible with the next system that will read the file.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Incorrect CSV format can cause the Java printer program to crash, preventing the user from continuing with the workflow, leading to user frustration.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} \texttt{CSV\_FORMAT\_VALIDATION} of exported CSV files must match the required structure and format expected by the next system that will read the file.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H5\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system shall implement auto-saving functionality to preserve user progress and enable recovery from any system crashes or hardware failures.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Any sysetm crashes or hardware failures can lead to signicant amount of work loss,which would require the user to restart the workflow from scratch, which would be very time consuming and frustrating.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system must automatically save user progress every \texttt{AUTO\_SAVE\_INTERVAL}.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H6\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} High

\item \emph{The system shall provide undo/redo functionality to allow users to correct their mistakes without losing signifcant work.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Human errors in design are common and users need the ability to easily correct these mistakes without restarting the process.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system must maintain an undo history of at least \texttt{UNDO\_HISTORY\_SIZE} actions and provide clear undo/redo controls.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H6\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} Medium

\item \emph{The system shall limit the number of voxels that can be selected simultaneously to prevent any performance issues.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Slecting too many voxels at a time can cause system slowdowns, UI freezing and an overall poor user experience.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} The system must limit voxel selection to a maximum of \texttt{MAX\_VOXEL\_SELECTION} voxels at any time and provide clear feedback when limits are reached.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H3\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} Medium

\item \emph{The system shall provide progress updates and timeout handling for long running operations such as importing/exporting the file, and voxelization.}\\
    \quad {\bf Rationale:} Large CAD files can take significant time to process, and users need feedback on progress to avoid waiting indefinitely.\\
    \quad {\bf Fit Criterion:} All import and export operations must timeout after \texttt{FILE\_IMPORT\_EXPORT\_TIMEOUT}, and all operations exceeding \texttt{FEEDBACK\_UPDATE\_TIME} must provide progress updates.\\
    \quad {\bf Associated Hazards:} H1, H2\\
    \quad {\bf Priority:} Medium

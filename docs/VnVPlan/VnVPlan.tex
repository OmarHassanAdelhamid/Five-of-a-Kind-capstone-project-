\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification}

The design verification will primarily focus on the system framework and integrated architecture that details the system implementation. Verification will take place through structured classmate and supervisor reviews. Reviews conducted by classmates will be designed to emphasize the interface design that permits usage of external libraries, internal refactoring and the primary database structure that encapsulates all voxel metadata. Feedback will be created into GitHub issues and discussed amongst the group in order to determine the best course of action to effectively integrate the feedback in subsequent development cycles.\\

\noindent Reviews conducted with our supervisor, Dr. Onaizah, will primarily verify tolerance parameters within the output framework during integration with specialized 3D printing software. Diagrams may be developed to provide visual aids to help facilitate the technical conversations and enhance understanding. These diagrams will default to standard UML diagrams, unless a more simplified diagram is required due to disparity in technical proficiency.\\

\noindent A checklist evaluation has been provided below for reference:\\

\end{itemize} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification}

The verification \& validation testing plan will also incorporate peer reviews and certain testing methodologies. It will be evaluated on the following 4 key metric categories: coverage, test effectiveness, testing methodology, and traceability. Peer reviews will be centered around structured checklists that guide meaningful assessment on the scope and completeness of the verification \& validation plan. Completeness within the scope of the plan should effectively address system scalability in regard to the software’s ability to manage growth in project size, complexity, and anticipated functional demands. There will be emphasis placed on ensuring effective coverage of user interactions with 3D renditions and all voxel data management operations. Feedback will be created into GitHub issues and discussed amongst the group in order to determine the best course of action to effectively integrate the feedback in subsequent development cycles.\\

\noindent Feedback will be integrated with an interactive development approach. Established functionality within the system will not be considered complete until complete testing in accordance with the verification \& validation plan has been completed. During weekly group meetings, updates related to a specific feature will require a corresponding update regarding related test cases that will be established. Tests must also be documented as GitHub issues. Upon closing a test case, the results must be documented within the issue. Results will be evaluated against a pre-defined baseline success metrics. \\

\noindent Within test validation, mutation testing will be integrated to assess the effectiveness of the system. This will include the assertion of defective input files, faulty voxel metadata updates, and unsupported display commands. Our goal with mutation testing is to generate quantifiable observations regarding our system’s capabilities of detecting undesirable anomalies.\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Implementation Verification}

Implementation verification will ensure that all segments of code strictly adhere to the requirements and constraints outlined in the SRS document as well as ensure adherence to the mandatory programming language’s conventions. Unit tests will be used in order to validate the core functionalities with the system. Pytest will likely be the primary testing framework for unit tests relating to the system components' development in Python. In a similar manner, Jest will be used to facilitate unit testing with the UI/UX of our system. Test cases will primarily focus on testing the functionality related to voxel modification requirements identified in F1-F4.\\

\noindent Static analysis will be conducted to ensure accordance with PEP 8, which is the official style guide for writing Python code. There will also be code inspections to verify secure and consistent file handling across all interconnected systems prior to running the code.  This is in accordance with SCR1, SCR4, and SCR5.\\

\noindent To ensure high implementation quality throughout all development cycles, code reviews will be on a minimum weekly basis (granted the code was modified throughout that period). These code reviews will incorporate the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item effective usage of external Python libraries in accordance with their usage guidelines
\item optimized voxel modification processes (F231, F233, F235, F239)
\item precise 3D rendition (F221, F222)
\item verification of future scalability (NF211)
\end{itemize}

\noindent Testing will also be done to evaluate the performance of implementation. In accordance with thresholds as defined in associated requirements, it will be evaluated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item data processing across file input and output workflows (NF212, NF242)
\item optimized interface responsiveness (F223)
\item large database interaction (NF232, SCR3)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\textbf{Unit Testing Framework (backend):} Since the backend of our system will be coded in Python, the primary testing framework used will be PyTest. This framework was chosen due to its flexible testing framework that can be scaled to support complex function testing. \\

\noindent\textbf{Code coverage tools  in PyTest:} PyTest offers a variety of tools, including the usage of the coverage.py library (pytest-cov), which allows extensive code coverage. It is able to monitor the program during execution and report what parts of the code have been executed. The plugin pytest-mock also provides a convenient way to mock objects and functions, including those in external libraries. This will be useful for testing an external voxel slicing library.\\

\noindent\textbf{Unit Testing Framework (frontend):} Currently, the primary testing framework that will be used for the front end is Jest, as we will be using the JavaScript library, Three.js, to generate the 3D image.\\

\noindent\textbf{Code coverage tools in Jest:} Jest offers several specialized libraries and techniques that can create image analysis tools for 3D image data evaluation. This includes tools such as snapshot test (jest-image-snapshot), which allows visual comparison. It also offers a mocking tool, which allows testing of specific property image components.\\

\noindent Ideally, the goal is to achieve 50\% coverage across both the frontend and backend of the codebases by the end of Rev 0. It is expected the PoC demo product will have significantly reduced coverage. However, coverage will be integrated through an interactive approach. Weekly reports will be generated from all coverage tools to track testing through the project. This will allow us to gain insight into overall test progress, understand general trends within code coverage, and provide clarity on what areas still require additional validation.\\

\subsection{Software Validation}

\textit{User Test Group}\\
\noindent To validate the usability of the system, a specialized test group will be selected based on the current typical users of the 3D printer. Testing will take the form of exploratory and acceptance testing. Users will be provided a list of tasks that they will attempt to navigate through with no prior instruction. The goal is to assess the system on the following aspects: usability, accessibility, discoverability, natural flow of interaction and system behaviour.\\

\noindent The list of tasks will closely relate to essential requirements. The list of tasks will depend on the current status of the project. However, tasks may include:
\begin{itemize}
\item create a new project with a given CAS file (F221)
\item generate a 3D image with a given voxel size (F213)
\item access the bottom face of the object (F223)
\item given desired voxel properties of 3 layers, replicate structure on software (F224 - F227, F231, F2313)
\begin{itemize}
\item all 3 layers will have the same voxel properties to see if the user experiments with property replication (F235)
\end{itemize}
\item erase all properties from the third layer
\item assign properties to the remaining voxels and export the project
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textit{Rev 0}\\
\noindent This will include a meeting with Dr. Onaizah to validate the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item implementation of SRS requirements
\item desired modifications to requirements or changes in user needs
\item how the system behaviour compares to specifications
\end{itemize}


\section{System Tests}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
\iffalse
\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}
\fi
\subsubsection{Usability and Look \& Feel}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-US-1 Design Acceptance \& Intuitivity Survey\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Survey-based

Covers: G4-HNF-1
					
Initial State: Application open
					
Input/Condition: User interacts with the application
					
Output/Result: Recorded observations, feedback, and survey response that indicates whether the design works for the user.
					
How test will be performed: Users will be exposed to the application with minimal direction and asked to perform 
some basic tasks. Observations such as where users get confused, when they need to consult the manual, and any comments
made during use will be recorded. Afterwards, users will fill out a survey relating to their satisfaction with the interface, 
as well as how they would rank how intuitive functionalities are on a 5-point scale. Observations and survey responses will then be analysed, with
changes implemented where necessary to improve UI design in the case that expectations are not reached. A draft of the survey
is included in the appendix of this document.

Quantifiable Metric: 90\% of survey responses must rank 4 or above for intuitiveness of each feature.

\item{test-US-2 Accessible Colours Check\\}

Type: Static, Manual

Covers: NF223, GEN1 %Need to add a general requirement to SRS about entire system colours.
					
Initial State: Default colours for materials and application chosen
					
Input/Condition: Constrast analyser run on colours
					
Output/Result: Compliance level meets WCAG standards
					
How test will be performed: A web-based contrast checking tool such as WebAIM will be utilised with both the set of colours chosen 
for material IDs, as well as colours used in the UI (e.g. text, buttons, sidebars).

Acceptance Criteria: All ratios must meet 3:1 contrast ratio for WCAG 2.0 compliance.

\item{test-US-3 Design Ease of Use Test\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Survey-based

Covers: NF231, GEN2 %need reqs for rest of app about max-interactions
					
Initial State: Application open
					
Input: User completes core tasks (import file, material/magnetization assignment, export file)
					
Output: 90\% of users tested complete tasks in less than MAX\_INTERACTIONS.
					
How test will be performed: After a short explanation of core tasks, users will be asked to perform core tasks. Clicks per task
are recorded and later analysed to verify that expectations are satisfied.

\item{test-US-4 View Model and Layer Focus within application\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Covers: S3 %Need a better way of citing this?
					
Initial State: Application open with an example project file pre-loaded
					
Input/Condition: Developer attempts to view an individual layer of the model
					
Output/Result: Application displays layer and full model separately, alongside interface to edit the layer.
					
How test will be performed: Tester will select a layer and attempt to view the layer separately, as well as the model as a whole, 
as if they intend to edit voxels within the layer. This confirms that the primary design notion of being able to focus on a specific
layer when editing voxels is satisfied.

\item{test-US-5 Clear and Interpretable Warnings and Errors\\}

Type: Survey-based

Covers: S4.1-7 %better way of citing this as well?
					
Initial State: Application open
					
Input/Condition: User performs interactions that are known to result in error
					
Output/Result: 90\% of respondents agree that errors are informative
					
How test will be performed: The user will be given direction in how to trigger different errors, and be exposed to
all warning and error messages the system can generate. Users will explain whether they find it easy to understand
or not (e.g. pass/fail). Investigation in how to reword prompts will take place for messages that under 90\% of users
do not understand.

Quantifiable Metric: For all messages, 90\% of users 'pass'.

\item{test-US-6 Concise and Interpretable User Manual\\}

Type: Survey-based

Covers: GEN3 %need to add a general requirement about availability/readability of user manual.
					
Initial State: Manual is completed
					
Input/Condition: User reads the full user manual
					
Output/Result: User agrees the manual is helpful with installation, general usage, and interpretation of common errors.
					
How test will be performed: User accesses the manual and reviews it. Afterwards, they give feedback on each section of 
the manual, pointing out areas of confusion or notes that should be added. Feedback is then incorporated upon revision
of the manual.

Quantifiable Metric: Considered an initial success if areas of confusion for each section is less than one.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Performance \& Scalability}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-PS-1 Scalability Validation for Import and Visualization\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Automated

Covers: NF211, NF222, implicitly tests NF212
					
Initial State: Application is open with a set of CAD files of varying sizes prepared.
					
Input/Condition: Sequentially, each CAD file is imported and the resulting voxel model is viewed within the application. 
					
Output/Result: Application completed import within expected times given MIN\_RATE and the estimated number of voxels in the resulting project
file from each input. Resulting voxel models render correctly within the application
					
How test will be performed: Import will be initiated on each CAD file (five files will be prepared, ranging from small (estimated 
100 voxels) to very large (1.5 * MAX\_VOXELS)). Timing will be started upon import, and stopped when the program reports the file was 
successfully imported and opens the project file. It will also be recorded whether the resulting project file renders without error.
If recorded times are not what is expected given MIN\_RATE and the size of the
resulting model, the import module will be investigated for possible sources of optimization. If the resulting file is not openable or does
not render, error messages will be investigated for possible sources of refactoring. %check this with HA times
					
\item{test-PS-2 Performance Validation for Import, Visualization, Editing, and Export\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Automated

Covers: NF212, NF221, NF232, NF242
					
Initial State: Application open with a set of CAD files of average sizes prepared.
					
Input/Condition: Sequentially, each file is imported, core operations completed, and exported
					
Output/Result: Latencies for import/view change/edit/export matches those defined in the above non-functional requirements.
					
How test will be performed: Import will be initiated on each CAD file (three files will be prepared, ranging from small (estimated 100 voxels)
to semi-large (100,000 voxels)). Timing and latency will be recorded for importing the CAD file, changing the orientation of the 
project file, opening layer focus, editing properties of voxel selections of varying sizes (1 voxel, 100, and a full layer), and exporting
the completed project file. These times will then be compared against the defined minimum latencies and expected times given minimum processing
rates. Should performance fall short of these expectations, specific sections that fail will have their code reviewed to identify areas 
that can be optimized. %check this with HA times (in/export)

\item{test-PS-3 Resource Usage Validation Test\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Automated

Covers: E3.4 %check citing this form.
					
Initial State: Application open, with a CAD file of average size prepared.
					
Input/Condition: File is imported, core operations completed, and exported
					
Output/Result: Recorded CPU and GPU usage over the course of the test does not exceed thresholds. %define these somewhere.
					
How test will be performed: Import will be initiated on the CAD file, and core operations will be performed (see test-PS-2's description). 
Throughout the test, CPU and GPU usage of the application on the host computer will be recorded. Should usage exceed defined thresholds, the operation
that lead to increased usage will be investigated for precisely what part of the operation triggered it, with refactoring of the unsatisfactory module.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Compliance}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-CO-1 Windows and Linux Compatibility Test\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Covers: E3.1
					
Initial State: Logged in to Windows and Linux and application is not installed
					
Input/Condition: User installs the application on both Windows and Linux
					
Output/Result: Application is successfully installed and functions as intended.
					
How test will be performed: The user will download the installer on each operating system, run it, and attempt to open the
application. If the application opens successfully on each OS and can perform basic functionalities, the test is ruled a success.
					
\item{test-CO-2 Import and Export Compatibility Test\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Covers: E3.2, E3.3
					
Initial State: Application open, with a CAD file of average size prepared.
					
Input/Condition: File is imported, core operations completed, and exported
					
Output/Result: Application converts input file correctly, exported file is correctly formatted
					
How test will be performed: The tester selects the CAD file to be imported, and verifies that the resulting project file 
is correctly generated (e.g. resulting voxel model is an accurate approximation of the original model). The tester then assigns 
dummy data to each layer and exports the project file to the 3D-printer ready format. The resulting file is then checked for
completeness and correct formatting. 

\item{test-CO-3 Project File Fail-safe\\} 

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual

Covers: NF241
					
Initial State: Application open, with a completed project file prepared.
					
Input/Condition: File is open, export is initiated and interrupted
					
Output/Result: Project file remains unaltered
					
How test will be performed: The tester begins the export process on the loaded project file, before intentionally ending the program
in the middle of the export. The project file is then checked against a copy of itself made before the test to see if there are any differences;
if there are no differences, the test is considered a success. 

\item{test-CO-4 PEP8 Standard Compliance\\}

Type: Static Analysis

Covers: DP.10
					
Initial State: Application is fully implemented
					
Input/Condition: Codebase is scanned with a linter (e.g. Pylint) %check this against dev plan
					
Output/Result: Code complies with PEP8 Standard
					
How test will be performed: Developer inputs the entirety of the application's backend code into a linting program and takes note of all
warnings. All areas of note are then addressed, with possible refactorings or small fixes resulting.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-MA-1 Maintainable Codebase\\}

Type: Static Analysis

Covers: DP.10, GEN4 % this req needs to be added to the SRS
					
Initial State: Application is fully implemented, and related documentation is complete
					
Input/Condition: Developers review all code and documentation
					
Output/Result: Code is sufficiently modular, and fully commented; associated documentation is easy to understand
					
How test will be performed: Reviewers inspect all code, evaluating based on modularity (functionality is sufficiently separated,
archicture supports editing one section not mandating updates throughout entire codebase), comments (both function/class headers and notes 
within functions, explaining complex or unclear code), and naming conventions (names of functions, classes, variables are consistent
and clear). Associated documentation is reviewed separately, evaluating based on completeness (all modules are detailed) and readability
(jargon is clearly defined; non-team members can understand the content).

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security}

Regarding the requirements listed in the Hazard Analysis document, they will not be explicitly tested for; examining each, we see that they
are implicitly tested for by the following system tests and/or unit tests.

\begin{itemize}
  \item SCR1: Implicitly tested for by test-FR-IM-3.
  \item SCR2: Infeasible to test at runtime as this would require access to hardware we have assumed we will not be working with within the SRS.
  Will be verified by unit tests that simulate a system with less memory.
  \item SCR3: Will be verified by unit tests related to the Editing manager that verify latency.
  \item SCR4: Implicitly tested for by test-FR-XM-1 and test-FR-XM-2.
  \item SCR5: Implicitly tested for by test FR-XM-3.
  \item SCR6: Implicitly tested for by test-FR-EM-6.
  \item SCR7: Implicitly tested for by test-FR-EM-7.
  \item SCR8: Will be verified by unit tests related to both the Visualization and Editing managers that verify limits of voxel selection.
  \item SCR9: Implicitly tested for by test-FR-XM-5.
\end{itemize}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}


\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{OPTIMAL\_VOXEL\_SIZE} = 5.5nm
  
  This was derived using the optimal voxel size specified by the stakeholder.
  
  \item \textbf{MAX\_VOXELS} = 13,996,800,000 voxels
  
  This considers the maximum number of voxels contained within the entire model.
  
  \item \textbf{MAX\_LAYER\_DISPLAY} = 518,400 voxels
  
  This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels contained within a single layer for a single display window.
  
  \item \textbf{MAX\_DISPLAY} = 103,680,000 voxels
  
  This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels that will be displayed at a given time.
  
  \item \textbf{MIN\_RATE} = 500,000 voxels per second
  
  This considers how fast voxel data will be generated during file import and export.
  
  \item \textbf{MAX\_EDIT\_LATENCY} = 1 second
  
  This considers how quickly the system should respond to model modifications performed by the user.
  
  \item \textbf{MAX\_VIEW\_LATENCY} = 500 ms
  
  This considers how quickly the system should respond to changes in model view orientation by the user.
  
  \item \textbf{MAX\_INTERACTIONS} = 5
  
  This considers the maximum number of steps (e.g. clicks, enter details into a text box) a user should take to complete a part of a task.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\iffalse
\wss{This is a section that would be appropriate for some projects.}
\fi

Each of the following questions is to be answered via a 5-point scale, with 1 being the least and 5 being 
the most except where otherwise listed.
This list may change or be updated as functionalities are added or removed.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How difficult was it for you to navigate the overall interface? (5 - very easily, 1 - with difficulty)
  \item Do you consider the current method of moving the model to inspect it intuitive?
  \item How natural do you find the layer select functionality?
  \item How intuitive did you find the method of selecting voxels?
  \item How easy was it for you to assign a magnetization vector to a set of voxels?
  \item How easy was it for you to assign a material to a set of voxels?
  \item Do you find the current signifiers for completed voxels helpful? (5 - very helpful, 1 - not very helpful)
  \item How intuitive did you find the file importing process?
  \item How intuitive did you find the file exporting process?

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

  Overall this deliverable went well. We were able to write up all the parts of minimal issues. The peer feedback we received during the TA review session was also helpful in ensuring that we were on the right track. One problem that we had was the time constraints, since all the members were busy with other assignments and midterms, so we had to work on this deliverable in a timely manner. Another thing that went well was our ability to communicate with each other, and ensuring that everyone was on the same page.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  

\textbf{Omar: }
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Daniel: }Responsible for the non-functional system tests, one pain point I dealt with was finding general system requirements that were missing from the SRS as I thought of possible tests for the areas of non-functional testing. Our group chose the Meyer template for the SRS, which I still believe to be the right choice for the project; however, with how the template divides up requirements between components, it becomes possible to miss requirements that the system should have as a whole. For example, not just one feature should have accessible colours, the entire application should. In addition, the SRS makes no mention of the manual, which of course needs to be accessible and user-friendly. As I developed tests that our system needed to satisfy, there were a handful of times I found the SRS did not have these types of general requirements, which will need to be added in a future iteration. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Andrew: } 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Olivia: } 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Khalid: }I was primarily responsible for writing the system tests for the Import and Visualization Managers. The main challenges that I had when writing up this section was ensuring that the tests were comprehensive and covered all the functional requirements that were listed for both manaers on the SRS. Additionally, I had to ensure that the tests were easy to understand and follow, and that they were able to catch all the potential errors and edge cases.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

  There are five major knowledges/skills our team will need to acquire:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Knowledge of PyTest Unit testing framework.} With PyTest being the main testing framework for the application's backend, 
    all team members will need to know its conventions.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge of Jest Unit testing framework.} Similar to above reasoning, Jest is the identified framework for testing
    the application's frontend.
    \item \textbf{Organizing Usability tests.} Beyond developing the test with the users themselves, knowing the right observations to take 
    note of is important to integrating feedback correctly.
    \item \textbf{Mutation testing skills.} Mutation testing is only as good as the variety of mutants produced.
    \item \textbf{How to conduct a code review.} Given the potential scale of the codebase and the limited time of team members, effective,
    time-efficient code reviews will be essential.
  \end{itemize}

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Knowledge of PyTest:} Approaches include reviewing existing online tutorials and documentation with the goal of achieving a
    broad understanding of the framework, with an alternative option of experimenting with the tool with a toy example program to gain practical experience.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge of Jest:} Similar to the above, a first option is to review documentation as needed, and a second to experiment creating tests
    in the framework to gain experience.
    \item \textbf{Usability Tests:} A first approach is to review course content from Human-Computer Interfaces, a course that covers how to 
    observe users and derive feedback from not just what they say, but how they behave with the interface, as well as non-obvious prompting methods.
    Another option is to review online material about how to conduct user testing that focuses on usability, and to possibly conduct a trial run 
    with peers.
    \item \textbf{Mutation testing:} Approaches include a reviewing content from Software Testing, a course all team members have taken that not only 
    covers how to come up with test cases, but mutation testing as well, and how to develop varying mutants. Another option is to review 
    academic papers detailing mutatation testing strategies, some of which can be found in the course materials of Software Testing.
    \item \textbf{Code Reviews:} Software Testing also included content detailing how code reviews are conducted in formal contexts, which could be 
    a helpful resource; ideas could be adapted to this project and provide a standard to consult. Another option involves running code reviews in other 
    projects team members are involved in throughout term to gain experience, which would benefit both this project and those involved.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Omar: }
  \newline
  \textbf{Daniel: }
  \textit{Knowledge of PyTest:} To become familiar, I will plan to rely on documentation as I feel I am familiar with unit testing frameworks and feel a majority of experience will likely carry over, with differences mainly centered around syntax.

  \textit{Knowledge of Jest:} Similar to PyTest, I plan to rely on documentation, likely moreso due to unfamiliarity with Javascript.

  \textit{Usability tests:} I plan to employ a mix of the two approaches, consulting online materials when I feel the course does not go into enough detail. I also plan to leverage the group project within the course to try out different user observation methods.

  \textit{Mutation testing:} I plan to review the academic papers discussed within Software Testing, as I personally feel the topic was glossed over within the course and is a subject I found intriguing. 

  \textit{Code reviews:} Similar to usability tests, I plan to leverage the other group projects I'm involved in this term, not only to benefit my experience with code reviews but to benefit those projects as well; with a skill that is as collaboration-centric as code reviews, the best way to learn is through experience.
  
  \textbf{Andrew: }
  \newline
  \textbf{Olivia: }
  \newline
  \textbf{Khalid:}
  \textit{Knowledge of PyTest:} I will use the online tutorials and documentation to help me gain a broading understanding of the testing framework. I think this will be a good starting point, as it will help me understand the framework theoretically, and then I can apply it to the project to gain practical experience.
  
  \textit{Knowledge of Jest:} Similar to the above, I will also use the online tutorials and documentation to help me gain a broading understanding of the testing framework. I will also experiment with the tool with a toy example program to gain practical experience.
  
  \textit{Usability tests:} For this skill, I will look over my notes from the 4HC3 (Human-Computer Interfaces) course, which covers how to observe users and derive feedback from both their responses. This was I can recall the content and apply it to the project.
  
  \textit{Mutation testing:} Similar to the above, I will look over my notes from the Software Testing course that covers not just test case development but also mutation testing strategies and how to develop varying mutants. I will also experiement with a simple program to gain practical experience.
  
  \textit{Code reviews:} I will look over my notes from the Software Testing course that covers how to conduct a code review. I will also experiment using some old code from other projects just to get a feel for the process.

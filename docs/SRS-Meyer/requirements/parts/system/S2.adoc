=== (S.2) Functionality & Prioritization

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**”. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

The following section outlines the specific functional and non-functional requirements, where each requirement has been defined within the scope of a specified component except for a few requirements that pertain to the entire system. Each requirement contains a section underneath that outlines the priority, likelihood of change, and justification to convey its relative importance and potential variability.

For certain requirements, variables have been defined. A description of each variable as well as its assigned value has been included below:

* *OPTIMAL_VOXEL_SIZE* = 5.5nm
This was derived using the optimal voxel size specified by the stakeholder.

* *MAX_VOXELS* = 13,996,800,000 voxels
This considers the maximum number of voxels contained within the entire model.

* *MAX_LAYER_DISPLAY* = 518,400 voxels
This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels contained within a single layer for a single display window

* *MAX_DISPLAY* = 103,680,000 voxels
This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels that will be displayed at a given time.

* *MIN_RATE* = 500,000 voxels per second
This considers how fast voxel data will be generated during file import and export.

* *MAX_EDIT_LATENCY* = 1 second
This considers how quickly the system should respond to model modifications performed by the user.

* *MAX_VIEW_LATENCY* = 500 ms
This considers how quickly the system should respond to changes in model view orientation by the user.

* *MAX_INTERACTIONS* = 5
This considers the maximum number of steps (eg. clicks, enter details into a text box) a user should take to complete a part of a task.

. [[NF243]] *Ease of use (NF243):* Export Manager shall ensure projects can be exported and/or saved in under MAX_INTERACTIONS.

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Medium (should-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# Similar to previous Ease of use requirements, these operations should be as streamlined as possible to be intuitive and quick.

==== (2.2.5) General Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements do not apply to a specfic component but instead to the system as a whole.

. [[GEN1]] *Manual Accessibility (GEN1):* The system shall include a user's manual that is details primary use cases, minimizes description to what is necessary, and considered interpretable by primary users.

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# High (must-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It is important that the included manual exhibits these properties, otherwise the document will not be helpful at its intended purpose - both helping new users learn how to accomplish their tasks with the system and acting as a quick reference to experienced users. 

. [[GEN2]] *Implementation Maintainability (GEN2):* The system shall be implemented in a modular, maintainable, and extensible fashion.

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# High (must-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# Ensuring the system exhibits these qualities is critical both during development to allow for easy modification and after, in the case that further revisions of the system are made. Given how these qualities are highly desirable, this requirement is inflexible.

=== (S.2) Functionality

ifndef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**”. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

The following section outlines the specific functional and non-functional requirements, where each requirement has been defined within a specific component scope.

For certain requirements, variables have been defined. A description of each variable as well as its assigned value has been included below:

* *OPTIMAL_VOXEL_SIZE* = 5.5nm
This was derived using the optimal voxel size specified by the stakeholder.

* *MAX_VOXELS* = 13,996,800,000 voxels
This considers the maximum number of voxels contained within the entire model.

* *MAX_LAYER_DISPLAY* = 518,400 voxels
This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels contained within a single layer for a single display window

* *MAX_DISPLAY* = 103,680,000 voxels
This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels that will be displayed at a given time.

* *MIN_RATE* = 500,000 voxels per second
This considers how fast voxel data will be generated during file import and export.

* *MAX_EDIT_LATENCY* = 1 second
This considers how quickly the system should respond to model modifications performed by the user.

=== (S.2) Functionality & Prioritization

ifndef::env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**”. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>
endif::[]

The following section outlines the specific functional and non-functional requirements, where each requirement has been defined within the scope of a specified component. Each requirement contains a section underneath that outlines the priority, likelihood of change, and justification to convey its relative importance and potential variability.

For certain requirements, variables have been defined. A description of each variable as well as its assigned value has been included below:

* *OPTIMAL_VOXEL_SIZE* = 5.5nm
This was derived using the optimal voxel size specified by the stakeholder.

* *MAX_VOXELS* = 13,996,800,000 voxels
This considers the maximum number of voxels contained within the entire model.

* *MAX_LAYER_DISPLAY* = 518,400 voxels
This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels contained within a single layer for a single display window

* *MAX_DISPLAY* = 103,680,000 voxels
This was derived assuming 960 voxels x 540 voxels per layer. It considers the maximum number of voxels that will be displayed at a given time.

* *MIN_RATE* = 500,000 voxels per second
This considers how fast voxel data will be generated during file import and export.

* *MAX_EDIT_LATENCY* = 1 second
This considers how quickly the system should respond to model modifications performed by the user.

* *MAX_VIEW_LATENCY* = 500 ms
This considers how quickly the system should respond to changes in model view orientation by the user.

* *MAX_INTERACTIONS* = 5
This considers the maximum number of steps (eg. clicks, enter details into a text box) a user should take to complete a part of a task.

. [[F238]] *Select layer* Editing Manager shall allow users to select an entire layer at once to enable easy assignment of a common material and magnetization amongst all voxels within a layer. (F238)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Low (could-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# High +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It promotes efficiency and reduces the time required for wide-scale property assignment. Change may occur if the software already sufficiently supports large-scale assignment and the feature becomes redundant.

. [[F239]] *Manual voxel alteration:* Editing Manager shall allow users to add and delete voxels of the same defined dimensions present in the rest of the model. (F239)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Medium (should-have) +

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Medium (should-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +

[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It is crucial for guaranteeing prompt and effective updates to the model. The latency threshold may change in relation to technical feasibility as long as there is no significant lag that jeopardizes update consistency.

==== (2.2.4) Export Manager

===== Functional Requirements

. [[F241]] *Property validation:* Export Manager shall validate that all voxels have received an assigned magnetization value upon receiving a request to export a file for printing (even if the assigned value is simply null to indicate no magnetization required). (F241)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Medium (should-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Medium +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It helps users ensure minimal issues during the printing stage. It may require modification if assigning null magnetization to unmagnetized voxels is determined to be unnecessarily demanding for users.

. [[F242]] *File export:* Export Manager shall produce a standalone file, containing all metadata for each voxel, that the user can name and save locally on their personal device outside of the software. (F242)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# High (must-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It is an essential function that enables users to print their model with complete property assignments. Due to its critical nature, there’s limited flexibility for change.

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Medium (should-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It is an essential function that enables users to create duplicates of their projects to support iteration (the equivalent of "Save as" functionality). With iteration being important to the design process, this is unlikely to change.

. [[F244]] *Exportation progress tracker:* Export Manager shall provide a progress bar that gives a visual indicator of how far along the software is in the exportation process. (F244)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Low (could-have) +

[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It can enhance the user experience by engaging users and reducing uncertainty, though not critical. Given the intensive nature of file export, changes may be required to improve progress tracking reliability.

. [[F245]] *Model summary:* Export Manager shall allow users the option to export a file that summarizes model statistics upon producing a standalone file of the model. (F245)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Low (could-have) +

[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It provides helpful information to the user regarding their overall model but is not critical to core functionality. The exported statistics will likely be adjusted to include data most relevant to a typical user.

===== Non-Functional Requirements

. [[NF241]] *Fail safe:* Export Manager shall ensure voxel data and metadata remain intact and unaltered in the event of an incomplete export, preserving the integrity of the project file without loss. (NF241)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# High (must-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# Low +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It promotes reliability and trust, maintaining a positive user experience. It is crucial that previous work is not lost during a failed export, which means there’s limited flexibility for change.

. [[NF242]] *Exportation performance:* Export Manager shall export metadata files for geometric models at a minimum rate of MIN_RATE. (NF242)

+
[.maroon]#_Priority:_# Low (could-have) +
[.maroon]#_Likelihood of change:_# High +
[.maroon]#_Justification:_# It ensures reduced wait time and improves overall user experience, though it is not critical. Changes to the MIN_RATE threshold may be necessary to sufficiently support high-demand operations.

=== (S.2) Functionality

ifdef::!env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**”. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>

. [[NF222]] *Visual scalability:* Imaging Manager shall support the visual display of voxel models that contain up to 10,000 voxels without significant degradation of performance or loss of functionality. (NF222)

==== (2.2.3) Magnetization Manager

===== Functional Requirements

. [[F231]] *View layer:* Magnetization manager shall provide users with an interface to choose a layer of their model, in which they can then easily view and select certain groups of voxels. (F231)

. [[F232]] *Set magnetization:* Magnetization manager shall allow users to set a specific magnetization value for either an individual or a  group of selected voxels. (F232)

. [[F233]] *Magnetization tracker:* Magnetization manager shall integrate easy tracking of what has already been magnetized by adjusting the colour of the voxel. (F233)

. [[F234]] *Favourite bar:* Magnetization manager shall allow users to define and maintain a list of ‘favourite’ magnetizations for quick selection and easy reuse. (F234)

===== Non-Functional Requirements

. [[NF231]] *Ease of use:* Magnetization manager shall ensure that the process of magnetizing a large group of selected voxels can be completed in 5 steps or less, creating an intuitive interface. (NF231)

. [[NF232]] *Metadata update:* Magnetization manager shall update the voxel magnetization metadata with a latency of less than 1s to allow consistent, synchronized model modification updates. (NF232)

==== (2.2.4) Exportation Manager

===== Functional Requirements

. [[F241]] *Magnetization validation:* Exportation Manager shall validate that all voxels have received a magnetization value upon receiving a request to export a file for printing. (F241)

. [[F242]] *Add to recent projects:* Exportation Manager shall add the file to a list of recent projects visible to the user for quick access and future edits. (F242)

. [[F243]] *Export to print:* Exportation Manager shall generate a file that contains all metadata for each voxel in a structured format. (F243)

===== Non-Functional Requirements:

. [[NF241]] *Printing compliance:* Exportation Manager shall ensure that the exported file is compatible with the existing Java software that is used to interpret geometric models for printing. (NF241)

. [[NF242]] *Exportation performance:* Exportation Manager shall export metadata files for geometric models at a minimum rate of 1000 voxels per second. (NF242)

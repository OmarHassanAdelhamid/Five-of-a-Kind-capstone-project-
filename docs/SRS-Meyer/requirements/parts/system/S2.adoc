=== (S.2) Functionality

ifdef::!env-draft[]
TIP: _**This is the bulk of the System book, describing elements of functionality (behaviors)**. This chapter corresponds to the traditional view of requirements as defining "**what the system does**”. It is organized as one section, S.2.n, for each of the components identified in <<s1>>, describing the corresponding behaviors (functional and non-functional properties)._  <<BM22>>

==== (2.2.3) Magnetization Manager

===== Functional Requirements

. [[F231]] *View layer:* Magnetization manager shall provide users with an interface to choose a layer of their model, in which they can then easily view and select certain groups of voxels. (F231)

==== (2.2.4) Exportation Manager
===== Functional Requirements

. [[F241]] *Magnetization validation:* Exportation Manager shall validate that all voxels have received a assigned magnetization value upon receiving a request to export a file for printing (even if assigned value is simply null to indicate no magnetization required). (F241)

. [[F242]] *Export to print:* Exportation Manager shall generate a file that contains all metadata for each voxel in a structured format. (F242)

. [[F243]] *Export magnetized model:* Exportation Manager shall generate a CSV file that provides a voxel-by-voxel description of the model’s magnetization. (F243)

. [[F244]] *Exportation progress tracker:* Exportation Manager shall provide a progress bar that gives a visual indicator of how far along the software is in the exportation process. (F244)

===== Non-Functional Requirements:

. [[NF241]] *Fail safe:* Exportation Manager shall ensure voxel data and metadata remain intact and unaltered in the event of an incomplete export, preserving the integrity of the magnetized project file without loss.(NF241)

. [[NF242]] *Exportation performance:* Exportation Manager shall export metadata files for geometric models at a minimum rate of 1000 voxels per second. (NF242)

=== (S.3) Interfaces

ifdef::!env-draft[]
TIP: _How the system makes the functionality of <<s2>> available to the rest of the world, particularly user interfaces and program interfaces (APIs). It specifies how that functionality will be made available to the rest of the world, including people (users) and other systems. These are interfaces provided by the system to the outside; the other way around, interfaces from other systems, which the system may use, are specified in <<e2>>._  <<BM22>>

==== (S.3.1) APIs

Within the current scope of this project, there will be no APIs build into the software for external use.

==== (S.3.2) Wireframe Mockup of Main Interface

Players will use this interface to interact with the generated 3D rendition of the CAD model while also viewing voxel layers to execute the core functionality of magnetizing voxels. It should demonstrate seamless and user-friendly navigation across multiple perspectives of the 3D model through rotation and resizing while allowing easy access to the different voxel layers and an intuitive magnetization process. The provided wireframe mockup showcases the simplest design that captures the essential functionalities in a well-organized interface that users will be able to navigate naturally without confusion.

=== (S.5) Prioritization

ifdef::!env-draft[]
TIP: _Classification of the behaviors, interfaces and scenarios (<<s2>>, <<s3>> and <<s4>>) by their degree of criticality. It is useful in particular if during the course of the project various pressures force the team to drop certain functions._  <<BM22>>

=== (G.1) Context and Overall Objectives
At McMaster University, the Engineering Research Department working on robotics and soft robotics has faced challenges in efficiently designing and modifying voxel-based 3D-printed components. While 3D printers and traditional CAD software are used, existing tools are time-consuming and inflexible, making voxel-level edits difficult and lengthy. By developing a tailored voxel design tool, Team Five of a Kind aims to provide a cost-effective and user-friendly solution that enables researchers to efficiently edit and magnetize voxels layer by layer. This tool will streamline the design process, enhance flexibility, and directly support the departmentâ€™s research in multi-material 3D printing.

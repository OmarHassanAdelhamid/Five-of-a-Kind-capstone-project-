=== (G.4) Functionality overview

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book). It is a short overview of the functions of the future system, a kind of capsule version of book S, skipping details but enabling readers to get a quick grasp of what the system will do._  <<BM22>>

The high-level functional requirements for the voxel-based design platform based on client input can be defined as follows, in no particular order:

• [[G4-HF-1]] *CAD-to-voxel conversion. (G4-HF-1)* The system shall allow importing standard CAD models and automatically voxelizing them into a structured grid for further editing. 

• [[G4-HF-2]] *Voxel editing and re-magnetization. (G4-HF-2)* The system shall enable assigning and re-assigning material and magnetization properties at the voxel level, allowing modifications after the initial design without rebuilding the entire model. 

• [[G4-HF-3]] *Batch voxel operations. (G4-HF-3)* The system shall support batch editing and magnetization of groups of voxels in specified directions, reducing repetitive manual work. 

• [[G4-HF-4]] *Visualization tools. (G4-HF-4)* The system shall provide visualization of material distribution and magnetization vectors across the voxel grid, assisting researchers in verification before fabrication. 

• [[G4-HF-5]] *Export compatibility. (G4-HF-5)* The system shall export voxelized designs into formats compatible with multi-material 3D printers, embedding metadata about material properties and magnetization. 

Of the functional requirements listed above, the two most critical are *CAD-to-voxel conversion* and *voxel editing and re-magnetization*, as these form the foundation of the system’s usability and research value.

Some high-level non-functional requirements for the platform can be defined as follows, in no particular order:

• [[G4-HNF-1]] *Usability. (G4-HNF-1)* The platform should have an intuitive interface suitable for both researchers and students, minimizing training overhead. 

• [[G4-HNF-2]] *Performance. (G4-HNF-2)* The system should handle CAD-to-voxel conversion and property assignment in a reasonable time, even for large and complex models.

• [[G4-HNF-3]] *Compatibility. (G4-HNF-3)* The platform should support common CAD file formats and integrate smoothly with existing 3D printing workflows.

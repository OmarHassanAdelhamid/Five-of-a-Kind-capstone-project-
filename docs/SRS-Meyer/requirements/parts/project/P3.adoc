=== (P.3) Schedule and Milestones

The development of the Five-of-a-Kind voxel magnetization system is planned over multiple sprints, beginning with comprehensive documentation and requirements analysis before transitioning to implementation. Our development strategy focuses on thorough planning and risk mitigation through proof of concept demonstrations, ensuring the system meets the specific needs of researchers working with magnetized 3D printed objects. The system addresses the critical bottleneck in current CAD workflows where researchers must manually rebuild objects voxel-by-voxel to assign magnetization directions, consuming hours per part and making iteration fragile.

  Complete initial project documentation including problem analysis, stakeholder identification, and development methodology. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent work and ensures team alignment on project scope and approach. The problem statement defines the core challenge: enabling per-layer voxel viewing, selection (single or multiple voxels), and re-assignment of magnetization directions on top of an imported CAD design, eliminating the need to rebuild objects manually in COMSOL.

**Justification for Proof of Concept Focus**

The proof of concept demonstration is strategically positioned to address the two primary risks identified in the development plan: unfamiliarity with dependencies for file conversion and ensuring the automated process is more efficient than manual rebuilding. By demonstrating successful CAD file import, voxelization with fixed dimensions (300×300μm XY, 110μm Z), and export to the existing Java-based printer program, we validate the core technical approach before investing in full UI development.

This approach allows us to identify and address any major technical challenges early in the development process, particularly around file format handling, voxelization algorithms, and integration with the existing printer workflow. The PoC will use command-line interfaces to focus on the core functionality, ensuring that the fundamental technical approach is sound before building the user interface layer.

The sprint-based approach also aligns with the team's development methodology, which emphasizes thorough planning, risk mitigation, and iterative validation. By completing comprehensive documentation and requirements analysis first, we ensure that the implementation phase is well-informed and addresses the specific needs of researchers working with magnetized 3D printed objects.

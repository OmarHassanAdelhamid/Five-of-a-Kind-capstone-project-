\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Extras}

The extras for this project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Manual}: This manual will provide a comprehensive guide and explanations on how to effectively use the software, emphasizing the key features that differentiate it from a normal CAD software. This is useful for helping users to operate the system independently, reducing the need for direct support, and ensuring they can utilize the system to its full potential with all of the features. To make it more user-friendly, the manual will be written in a way that is easy to understand and follow, with clear instructions and examples. It will also include any safety warnings that are relevant to the software.
    \item \textbf{Usability Report}: This report will document the findings from usability testing, including identified pain points, user feedback, and recommendations from stakeholders for improving the user experience. It will also include information about how the testing was held, including the number of participants, the tasks they were given, the questions they were asked, and its initial results. This is useful for ensuring the product is intuitive, efficient, and satisfying for its target audience, leading to higher user adoption and satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}
